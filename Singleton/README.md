## Introduction
This project demonstrates the **Singleton Design Pattern** in Java. The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to it. This is particularly useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.


## Design Overview
The Singleton Pattern is a **creational design pattern** that restricts the instantiation of a class to a single object while providing a global access point to it.

In this project:
- A single instance of the `Singleton` class is created and shared across the application.
- The `getInstance` method ensures controlled access to the single instance.


## Key Components
#### 1. **Private Constructor**
The constructor of the `Singleton` class is private to prevent instantiation from outside the class.

#### 2. **Static Instance**
A static field holds the reference to the single instance of the class.

#### 3. **Public Static Method**
A public static method (`getInstance`) provides a global access point to the instance and ensures that only one instance is created.

#### 4. **State Management**
The `Singleton` class includes methods (`getValue` and `setValue`) to demonstrate state management using the single instance.


## How It Works
1. When `getInstance` is called for the first time, it creates an instance of the `Singleton` class and stores it in the static field.
2. Subsequent calls to `getInstance` return the same instance, ensuring only one instance exists.
3. The `Singleton` instance’s state can be modified and accessed globally, demonstrating the pattern in action.


## Benefits of the Singleton Pattern
- **Controlled Instantiation**: Ensures only one instance of the class exists.
- **Global Access Point**: Provides a single, globally accessible instance.
- **Lazy Initialization**: The instance is created only when it is needed, saving resources.
- **Adherence to SOLID Principles**:
    - **Single Responsibility Principle**: Controls the number of instances.
    - **Open/Closed Principle**: The class is closed for modification but can be reused in different contexts.
- **Consistent State Management**: Changes to the state of the Singleton instance are reflected across all references.


## Limitations of the Singleton Pattern
- **Not Thread-Safe by Default**:
    - The basic implementation is not thread-safe, and multiple threads may create multiple instances in a race condition.
- **Testing Challenges**:
    - Singleton classes are hard to mock or isolate in unit tests, leading to tightly coupled test cases.
- **Global State**:
    - Improper use of Singleton can lead to hidden dependencies and make debugging harder.
- **Overuse**:
    - Singleton is sometimes overused, leading to anti-patterns like God objects.
- **Limited Scalability**:
    - It doesn’t support scenarios where multiple instances might be necessary (e.g., distributed systems).
