## Introduction
This project demonstrates the **Prototype Design Pattern** in Java using a game development example. The Prototype Pattern simplifies object creation by copying an existing instance (a prototype) rather than creating a new object from scratch.

In this project:
- A base `Enemy` prototype is defined.
- New enemies are created dynamically by cloning the base prototype and optionally modifying their properties.


## Design Overview
The Prototype Pattern is a **creational design pattern** that allows:
- Cloning of existing objects to create new instances.
- Simplified object creation when the instantiation process is resource-intensive or involves a lot of configurations.

In this project:
- The `Enemy` class serves as the prototype.
- New enemy instances are created by cloning the prototype and using modification methods to customize their properties.


## Key Components
### 1. **Prototype Interface**
Defines a method `clone()` for copying objects. In this project, it is represented by the `Prototype` interface.

### 2. **Concrete Prototype (`Enemy`)**
Implements the `Prototype` interface and provides a concrete implementation of the `clone()` method using a copy constructor.

### 3. **Client**
The client code utilizes the prototype (`Enemy`) to create new objects by cloning and customizing them.


## How It Works
1. The base prototype (`Enemy`) is created with default properties.
2. The client clones the prototype using the `clone()` method.
3. The cloned object is customized using setter methods to modify specific properties, such as `health`, `damage`, or `type`.

Example:
- A "Goblin" prototype is created.
- Cloned goblins are customized as "Scout Goblin" or "Strong Goblin" by adjusting their properties.


## Benefits of the Prototype Pattern
1. **Performance**:
    - Avoids the overhead of creating new instances from scratch.

2. **Flexibility**:
    - Allows runtime modifications and creation of variations without affecting the prototype itself.

3. **Simplified Object Creation**:
    - Reduces the complexity of creating objects with multiple attributes or configurations.

4. **Code Reusability**:
    - The prototype serves as a reusable template for creating similar objects.


## Limitations of the Prototype Pattern
1. **Cloning Complexity**:
    - For objects with complex structures (e.g., deep copies or references to other objects), implementing the clone method can be non-trivial.

2. **Potential Coupling**:
    - The client code becomes dependent on the prototype’s implementation of the `clone()` method.

3. **State Management**:
    - If the prototype's state changes unexpectedly, it can affect future clones.
